> The content in the **lift.pf** properties file is case sensitive. Make sure that when you change values noted below that you keep the values in lowercase or Uppercase. For instance, the **target-user** is in lowercase but the **target-schema** is in Uppercase. Keep them in the same case when doing changes.
>
